    <p>Both deer and fox are straight-line walkers. They step with the hind foot falling exactly in the track of the front foot. Thus, the pattern in the snow appears that the animals are two-legged. This behavior is called “registering” and it helps the animal to conserve energy when walking in deep snow.</p>
    <p>A deer hoof is easy to see when the snow is packed, and they usually drag their hooves. However, in deep snow, the hooves are more spread out and the dew claw is visible in the back of the track. Hoof prints point in the direction the deer is walking.</p>
