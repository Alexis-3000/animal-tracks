    <h2>Identifying Tracks in the Snow</h2>
    <p>Winter snow provides a wonderful medium to record evidence of which animals have travelled through an area. Identifying tracks in the snow can be a bit like detective work. Consider every scrap of evidence while it exists. Snow is ephemeral and constantly changing so impressions can easily get distorted as the snow melts or sublimates, or tracks fill in with drifting snow, or get covered by debris and other tracks.</p>
    <p>Use hints from the habitat. It helps to know what animal species frequent the area you are in. In winter, you are most likely to see the tracks of mammals and some birds.</p>
    <p>Refine your track identification by looking at an animalâ€™s trail, the series of tracks in the snow. You can discern a lot just by noticing the track pattern in that trail, i.e., the distinctive arrangement of the paw or hoof prints that gives you clues about its gait.</p>
